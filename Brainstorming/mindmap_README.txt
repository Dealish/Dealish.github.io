Original MindMap was created using MindNode, (extension .mindnode)

  - Downloading MindNode for free will allow the user to view the MindNode file.

  - Paying for the app will allow the user to edit the MindNode file.

  - MindNode is a MacOs and iOS only application and can be downloaded at the
  following link:
                  https://mindnode.com

The MindNode file has been exported to the FreeMind format (.mm).
  - The OpenSource FreeMind extension allows mind maps to be imported into
    other outline enabled apps.

  - Importing a .mm format does not preserve formatting nor does it import
    the images within the .mindnode file. I am exploring other options
    make this file accessible, including exploring the .opml extension.

  - In the meantime, I have imported the .mm file into the Coggle web app which
    can be used to view the mind map online without downloading software.

    - Please see the link below to view the mind map via .mm extension without
      photos:
