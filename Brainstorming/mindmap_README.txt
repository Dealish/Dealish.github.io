Original MindMap was created using MindNode, (extension .mindnode)

  - Downloading MindNode for free will allow the user to view the MindNode file.
  - Paying for the app will allow the user to edit the MindNode file.
  - MindNode is a MacOs and iOS only application and can be downloaded at the
  following link:
                  https://mindnode.com

It is preferred to view the MindNode file, and has been exported in PDF.
    - A PDF version of the MindNode file has been exported and stored
      on Github and the Google Drive to make this easy to view but not edit.

The MindNode file has been exported to the FreeMind format (.mm) to further
explore collaborative editing. Only Billy has been able to create and edit the
mind map without having anyone else purchase software.
  - The OpenSource FreeMind extension allows mind maps to be imported into
    other outline enabled apps.
  - However, importing an .mm format does not preserve formatting nor does it
    import the images within the .mindnode file. Billy is exploring other
    workflow options to preserve formatting and make this file accessible for
    collaborative editing by exploring the .opml extension.
      - Lost formatting from .mindnode to .mm extension includes lost embedded
      hyperlinks, photos, text sizes, connecting arrows, etc.
  - In the meantime, I have imported the .mm file into the Coggle web app which
    can be used to view the mind map online without downloading software.
    - Please see the link below to view the mind map via .mm extension without
      photos:
